# Salvos

Welcome to Salvos, a low poly game where the game is super new, and needs time to be created! We have currently a debug build and you can find the newest releases [here](https://github.com/ThomasAunvik/Salvos/releases).

Now, before you get confused and ask many other question, What is a demo build?

### Demo Build

A demo build is just a build where you test the current content, but dont be sad, whatever its in the demo build might either get removed forever, or it stays and or get improved over time.
